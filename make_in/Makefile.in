# Strict aliasing is really interesting. -fno-strict-aliasing relaxes the coding rules, but makes
# some code run a little slower. I'm not seeing a real difference at the moment, so turning it off
# I think to get the real speed, you turn on -fstrict-aliasing, and the appropriate -W, which 
# generates a few warnings in our code where type punning is used for printf sanity. This
# also interacts with the restrict keyword, which I understand in theory, but attempts to use
# it throw errors out of the compiler so I don't understand it yet.
#
# Removing the frame pointers does add a few percent in speed, too, but we need better debugging
# at this point...
#
# And the jury's a little out on -mss3 and -msse4. They aren't turned on by -march=native,
# even though native should understand that those are the preferred types, and available.

# Tree vectorize is turned on the in the O3 mechanism. It's fascinating to turn on the tree vectorize
# debugs. Very rarely do we have loops that vectorize, because we often use functions in our loops.
# and, sometimes loops are vectorized but will need lengths greater than 20 or 30 to show speed improvements,
# loops of this size are unlikely in our code.
#
# O3 also enables -finline-functions, among other things.
